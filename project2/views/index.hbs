      <h5>The Mentors</h5>
      They have been there - transitioning, climbing the ladder, facing their fears and challenges of the industry.
      They
      will meet you in the middle. They are here to show you your own capabilities and support you in your journey of
      career transition and transformation. They lead by example. You’ll find them in the fields of UX/UI, Web Dev,
      Data
      Science, and Product Management.

    <span class=" index-info border border-dark hover-m">

      <h5>The Mentees</h5>
      The seekers for more, forever growing and evolving. Brave to change their horses midstream. Brave to shake their
      lives up and challenge the way things are done. Ready to dilute the solidified status quo and enter the new
      phase
      of their careers in tech. Ready to join thousands of women, representing the other half of population and their
      best interests.
